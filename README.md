# Interactive-Warehouse-Map

Over the summer of 2022, I worked as a truck unloader at Peavey Industries. I really enjoyed my time there, I made friends, the environment was nice, and the work wasn't too hard. I started this job with the crazy idea that I would somehow try to get into the IT department. I didn't know how I would do it, but that was my dream.

The job of many of the workers consists of locating products all around the warehouse for shipment. I noticed there were no maps of the warehouse available, or at least to us workers. I felt that with the proper tools available, this work could be completed a lot faster; so I started thinking. I began by drawing the floor plan of the warehouse, labelling all the different sections that I frequently went to. This made things slightly easier however, taking out a crumpled-up paper map from your pocket when you need to navigate somewhere clearly isn't the best solution.

My next idea was to create a map using AutoCAD and save it onto my phone. That way I would always have it on me and I would be able to zoom in and pan around, making the intricate areas of the warehouse easily readable on the map. Before I even finished creating this map in AutoCAD I had another idea; I should be able to input a product number and it will display the exact location of the product on the map.

Right away I started figuring out how I could make this happen. I began by making a program in Python, as this was the language I had been using most at the time. Soon, I realized that neither I nor Stack Overflow had a quick and easy solution for what I needed to do. I then switched to Java, where I got the basic fundamentals of my idea working almost immediately. I spent a few days developing this program in Java where users could search for a product and it would display the location on the map.

After getting much of the rough work done for this program, I had realized I need this to run on a phone. At that point I switched from Java to Swift. Over the course of a couple weeks, a lot of information collection, and many code iterations, I managed to bring my idea into reality. I began using it myself at work, and like I had expected, my application made my work much easier.

After being the fastest worker in the warehouse for a couple of days, I decided it was time to start showing some people the solution to their everyday struggles. I presented it to a few workers and they all wanted it immediately.

On my last day of work before I had to return to school, I presented my solution to a vice president of the company and he liked it. I then went on to have multiple meetings with other vice presidents, managers, and higher-ups that I didn’t even know the role of. Soon after, they offered me a job as a software developer. My goal coming into the company of getting a spot in the IT department was not only completed, it was surpassed.

As of October 2022, I, along with a few others including my project manager, are working to develop this application even further. Introducing features I had only thought of but were impossible to do without the company’s support. As well as fully implementing this application into the warehouse’s current inventory management system.

I am very excited and grateful for the opportunity I somehow found myself in, and can’t wait to see the future of this project.
